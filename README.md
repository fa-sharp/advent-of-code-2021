# Advent of Code - 2021

These are the problems from [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). I originally wanted to challenge myself by using different languages as I go through it. I ended up using Rust for a lot of them, as I apparently enjoy being in an ongoing, epic battle with a compiler.

## Languages used
 - Python (Days 1, 8)
 - Rust (Days 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12)
 - JavaScript (Day 4)
